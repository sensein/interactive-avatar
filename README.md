# NextGen Project: LLM-Powered Educational Avatar

This repository contains the code for the NextGen Project, which aims to build and validate an interactive avatar controlled by a large language model (LLM) for educational purposes. The avatar offers various educational activities, including some designed to enhance vocabulary in children.

## Project Overview (dedicated website coming soon!!)

Vocabulary knowledge is the single best predictor of reading achievement and school completion. Socioeconomic gaps in vocabulary knowledge are well documented, and current approaches implemented in schools have failed to close these gaps. Our project evaluates the usability and effectiveness of a speech-based LLM-empowered conversational tutor designed to enhance vocabulary in children interactively and personalized. The tutor engages children with read-aloud digital books, explicit teaching, and word meaning evaluation.
